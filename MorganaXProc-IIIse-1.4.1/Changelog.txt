- Improved error messaging for p:cast-content-type from XML to JSON if the document is in an unsupported format. 
   Thanks to Erik for pointing this out.
 - Fixed a bug in p:error where an invalid c:errors document was produces if more than one document appears 
 	on port "source". Thanks again to Erik for reporting this.
- Fixed a bug where catalogs are not used to resolve DTDs when loading documents with doc in p:xslt or p:xquery. Thanks to
    Ari for bringing this up.

   again reporting by Erik. Thanks for this.

MorganaXProc-III 1.4
- Fixed issue #125 in p:store's serialization handling: If doc has a serialization property and there is a serialization option, now
   the first takes precedence.
 - Fixed issue #126: Two adjacent groups are treated as overlapping groups. Thanks to Boris for reporting this.
 
 Changes for XProc 3.1 and XProc 3.1 Standard Step Library last call (20 August 2024):
- Implemented signature change of p:insert: Text documents now allowed on port "insertion". Result can be a text document.
- Added option "parameters" on p:uuid.
- Changes in p:ixml: New error codes used for (a) more than one document on port "grammar" and (b) not invalid grammar.  
   Both were XD030 before.

    to Thorsten for supplying use cases.
 - Improved error handling for Saxon12Connectors: If used with Saxon 12.3 (and later) you now get a distinct error
   message for using the wrong connector.
 - Improvements in Saxon connectors for p:xquery:
 	- Added support for using xml-resolver,
 	- improved error messaging,
 	- a validating processor now supports CLI switch "XQueryValidationMode" and parameter key "mox:validation-sources"
       as "XSLTValidationMode" for p:xslt.

MorganaXProc-III 1.3.12
- Fixed issue #123: Bug in handling nested maps with p:xslt, p:xquery (and p:validate-with-xml-schema) when a

- New feature in EE: With serialization option 'mox:sort-attributes'. Default is 'false', changes nothing. If 'true()' attributes
   on elements are sorted by namespace-uri first and by local-name second. This feature should improve comparing different
   versions of a document. (Thanks to Thorsten for suggesting this feature)

MorganaXProc-III 1.3.8

- New key supported in p:xsl-formater's option 'parameter'. "mox:fop-msg-level" can be used to control the level of message
   written from FOP to message-stream. Valid values are "'OFF', 'INFO', 'WARN', 'ERROR' or 'FATAL'". New default (was 'INFO') is
   now "WARN".
 - Fixed bug in the signature of p:validate-with-json-schema: Option 'default-version' is now xs:string? (was xs:string*).
 - Fixed a bug where baseURI of resolved entities were not correctly handled. Thanks to Norm for giving the hint.
 - Slight improvement of node memory consumption.
 - Fixed a bug in p:unarchive, where a document that is not a ZIP should raise XC0081, but raised XC0085. Thanks to Norm for the hint.

 - Fixed a bug with 'xml:base' on p:add-attribute and p:set-attributes were change of base-uri was not correctly handled.
 - Change of raised error in p:archive: XC0081 is now raised instead of XC0085 if content-type of document on port "archive"
    does not match (implicit) value of option "format".
  - Harmonized exit codes: All non license related exit codes are now positive integers.

     not a ZIP, XC0081 is raised now. (Was XC0085 before.) CAUTION: This change might break existing pipelines catching only this
     specific error. 
  - Fixed a bug in p:filter where error XD0016 was raised for errors in XPath expression in option "select". CAUTION: This change 
  	 might break existing pipelines catching only this specific error. 

MorganaXProc-III 1.3.7
- Standard function "p:system-property()" now also returns values for MorganaXProc-III's configuration like xslt-connector etc.
- New function "mox:system-properties() as map(xs:QName,item()*)" returns all known properties and their value. If no
   value is set for a property, "" (empty string) is associated.
- For p:text-sort/@collation a collation URI starting with "https:" is now silently changed to "http:". Thanks to Norm for this hint.
- New step "mox:text-wrap-lines" to split text documents in lines and wrap an element around each line. Additionally you can
   choose to add an attribute with the line number to the element.

- EE only: Additional properties on p:os-info are namespaced now. (Issue #523)
- Fixed a bug where QName in attributes are not correctly resolved.
- Added support for unparsed entities on p:load/p:document. They are recognized now and are
  flow between steps. This (partially) fixes a bug reported by Pascal. Thanks for this. The bug
  is only partially fixed because all document changing steps (p:add-attribute etc.) do not
  emit unparsed entities on port "result" even though the were on port "source".
- Minor speed improvements for schema validation with SaxonEE.  

MorganaXProc-IIIse 1.0
- Fixed bug in p:http-request sending binary documents. Thanks to Axel for reporting it and
  suggesting the fix.

  possible value restrictions via option's @values.
- Improved mechanism for supplying AVT to steps: As AVT are xs:untypedAtomic and the values
  in option's @values have typically another type, option values had to be given with p:with-option
  until now. The new mechanism does some implicit type conversion before checking values.

  removed from the result tree. Again thanks to Thorsten.
- p:load/@parameters and consequently p:document/@parameters now accepts key 'mox:remove-ignorable-whitespace'.

- Minor speed improvements while loading schemas in p:validate-with-xml-schema.
- Fixed issue #95 where in p:validate-with-xml-schema (using SaxonEE) a location hint is used, 
  although this should not happen.

MorganaXProc-IIIse 0.9.13

- Fixed issue #13:  where the empty sequence as a result of an AVT is not correctly handled but raises an error condition.
- Fixed an issue where an implicitly created output port and a output port with no-name have different name, which might
  result in an XS0102.
- Possible fix for ticket #12: Explicitly using "UTF-8" encoding to extract string from documents to calculate hash.
- Changed result map of p:cast-content-type with content-type="application/json" with a c:param-set document to
  map(xs:QName, xs:string).
- p:unarchive now supports an entry "mox:content-types" in parameters. It expects an array where each entry is itself
  an array with two entries: a regular expression and a content-type. If present, the regular expressions are considered
  in order, if matched, the content-type is used to unarchive the document. If none of the regex matches, the build
  in default guess for content-type is used. Note: The regex are not auto-anchored.
- For p:unarchive and p:directory-list it seems to be implementation defined whether the regex are auto-anchor. In
  MorganaXProc-IIIse 0.9.1.6 they are NOT auto-anchored ANYMORE.

- Removed @visibility from p:variable. See Change Log in core specs.
- Reworked command line interface for setting atomic values to options. If an option is marked as + or *,
- Added command line setter "-static" to set values for static options on the command line,
  the given value is first interpreted as an XPath expression. If that fails, a single value casting is performed.
- Added command line setter "-statics:uri". See statics-defs.xml for an example.
- Reworked configuration of Xerxes parser so you do not get the annoying message 
  "[Fatal Error]  Content is not allowed in prolog." anymore. [Thanks to Erik for pointing this out to me.]
- Fixed a bug in calculating the graph for an explicit connection from within a compound step to an ancestor/sibling.
- Fixed isuse #11: A bug in the graph for p:catch resulting in "Problem found checking '..'.  1 expected, but '0' delivered.".
